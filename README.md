# Notes
Udacity is backed by nodejs, handlebars.  
[Ace](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace) code editor is used by udacity.  
If force update is checked in the service worker under application tab, then for every request the serviceworker gets updated **even if the sw hasn't changed** and because of this the install event also runs  
Shift+f5 doesn't make the install event to occur, it only refreshes page ignoring cache.  

`F5` or `Control + R` = Reload the current page  
`Control+Shift+R` or `Shift + F5` = Reload your current page, ignoring cached content  

if the browser detects a new sw.js, it keeps the new one in waiting state. After you navigate to another site which isn't controlled by the old sw, and get back, the waiting sw gets activated
